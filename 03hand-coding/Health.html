    <h1>Where to start</h1>
    <h2>Easy changes to your life will make a big difference!</h2>
    <p>To avoid feeling overwhelmed when making lifestyle changes, start small and focus on one habit at a time. Trying to overhaul your entire routine at once can be discouraging, so begin with something simple, like drinking more water or adding a short daily walk. Once that becomes a natural part of your day, gradually introduce other healthy habits. Setting realistic goals and breaking them into smaller steps makes the process feel more manageable and less intimidating. Sticking with healthy habits requires consistency and patience. Choose changes that fit into your routine and feel sustainable rather than forcing drastic adjustments. Celebrate small progress along the way, whether it's having more energy, sleeping better, or simply feeling good about making an effort. If you slip up, don’t get discouraged—just refocus and keep going. Over time, these small actions add up to lasting improvements in your health and well-being.</p>
